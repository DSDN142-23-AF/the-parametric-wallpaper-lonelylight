You will need to fill out this file for hand in. 

The bellow is just an example, feel free to disregard this documents contents.


Your final settings.txt will look something like this when you are finished:

/////////////////////////////////

Wallpaper 1:

//your parameter variables go here!
let rect_width  = 1;//pixel size(better not change it)
let rect_height = 1;
let r_data = Math.floor(Math.random()*255);;//random choose a base rgb color from 0-255
let g_data = Math.floor(Math.random()*255);;
let b_data = Math.floor(Math.random()*255);;
let r_pointer = true;//rgb number gradient pointer(if true->raise;false->down)
let g_pointer = true;
let b_pointer = true;
let gradient_counter = 0;
let gradient_limit = 100;//how many times you draw the pixel then change the gradient degree?(doesn't change so much, this is just for test and fun)
let offset = 2;//color change offset(desire the degree of color change)
//note: this vars do not need to change, every time you generate a picture is different, whatever you changed variables will not make so many difference.
//fun things: looks like the wallpaper generater will draw 12*5 each time, not just copy and paste same things.
//so this mean i make a wall paper that got each cell is different, randomize works very well.
//good news: no need to check this file.
